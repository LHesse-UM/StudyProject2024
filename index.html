        <h2 id="aboutTheProject">1. About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project explores human activity patterns in London throughout 2020, a year marked by the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic.
            By analyzing daily movement data and focusing on Polygons of Interest (POIs), such as transit hubs, parks, and event venues, we aim to understand how the pandemic influenced urban mobility.
            Our analysis offers insights into the reduction of activity during lockdowns, the rebound effects post-restrictions, and the shifting dynamics of human movement in response to public health measures.

        <h2 id="dataAquiAndProces">2. Data Acquistion and Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>
            The foundation of this project is the 2020 movement data of London, which provides daily aggregated metrics of human activity.
            These data points are complemented by geospatial information, including:
            Geo-coordinates linked to specific locations,
            London borough boundaries, and
            Points of Interest (POIs) categorized by function and significance.
            Preprocessing involved cleaning, mapping, and aggregating the data for analysis.
            Special focus was given to temporal patterns, allowing us to identify activity trends before, during, and after key COVID-19 milestones, such as lockdown announcements or easing measures.

            <h3>2.1 Movement Data</h3>
            <p>
                The movement data of London has a column mean_column.
                It has a values ranging from 0.000003 to 2.892247.
                These values are to be seen in relation to the average movement in UK.
                1.0 would mean in this case that in this 100x100 area the movement was like the average in the UK.
                0.5 means only half as much and 2.0 means twice as much movement.

            <p>
                The <b>Temporal Data</b> section highlights how mobility patterns in London evolved throughout the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
                By dividing the year into <b>distinct intervals</b> aligned with major policy changes and restrictions,
                we analyze the short- and long-term effects of lockdowns, reopenings, and other interventions on human activity.
            </p>

            <h3>2.3.1 Corona Intervals</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                To better understand mobility changes, the year 2020 has been divided into
                <b>seven key intervals</b>, each corresponding to major COVID-19 measures or milestones.
                The time intervals are based on governmental documents that can be found

                        <li><b>First Lockdown</b> (Mar 26 - May 10): Strict nationwide lockdown causing sharp declines in movement.</li>
                        <li><b>Return to Relaxing Restrictions</b> (May 11 - Oct 13): Gradual easing of restrictions leading to activity rebounds.</li>
                        <li><b>Three-Tier System</b> (Oct 14 - Nov 4): Regionalized restrictions based on infection rates.</li>
                        <li><b>Second Lockdown</b> (Nov 5 - Dec 1): Reimposition of nationwide restrictions.</li>
                        <li><b>End of Second Lockdown</b> (Dec 2 - Dec 20): Temporary recovery under tiered restrictions.</li>
                        <li><b>Four-Tier System in London</b> (Dec 21 - Dec 31): Strict "Stay at Home" orders applied to London.</li>

            <h3>2.3.2 Events Dataset</h3>
            <p>
                The <b>Events Dataset</b> focuses on <b>specific dates</b> where notable events and policy decisions occurred.
                These events include significant football matches, concerts, and public gatherings,
                particularly in key <b>Polygons of Interest (POIs)</b> such as football stadiums and large event venues.
                By examining mobility patterns during these events,
                we gain a deeper understanding of the short-term fluctuations in movement across London.
            </p>
            <p>
                The table below summarizes these significant events, their corresponding dates, and their places:

            <p>
                By analyzing mobility patterns during these <b>events</b>, particularly at football stadiums and event venues,
                we can identify spikes in activity that correspond to crowd movements.
                Additionally, when combined with the <b>Corona Intervals</b>,
                this dataset provides insights into how lockdowns and reopening phases impacted public gatherings at key POIs.

                By selecting and comparing maps from various phases — such as Pre-Corona, First Lockdown, and Four-Tier Restriction Phase — users can visually assess the impact of
                lockdowns and reopening policies on urban mobility.

            <h3>3.2 ST-DBSCAN</h3>
            <p>
                ST-DBSCAN, or Spatio-Temporal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, is a clustering algorithm that integrates both spatial and temporal dimensions. Applied to London’s movement data with the predefined time intervals, ST-DBSCAN identified patterns across different periods. To illustrate the algorithm's capabilities, three specific examples—Westminster, Greenwich, and Regent's Park—were selected to demonstrate how movement clusters manifest in distinct urban areas. A slider interface allows for navigation through the various time intervals, enabling the visualization of movement patterns over time. For each predefined interval, a span of 20 days was chosen to ensure the analysis remained computationally manageable. In this study, the epsilon parameters were set with eps1 at 0.0006 and eps2 encompassing approximately one week. However, it is important to note that these parameter choices are not ideal; converting the movement data into a metric system would have allowed for more accurate and undistorted search radii for the clusters. Additionally, more extensive testing would have been necessary to optimally select the parameters, but hardware limitations prevented this. Nonetheless, several effective clusters were still identified and are analyzed in the following sections. These limitations are further discussed in the limitations section. By analyzing how movements are distributed in space and change over time, the algorithm uncovered significant trends, providing valuable insights into urban movement behaviors.            </p>

                        Applying ST-DBSCAN to Westminster’s movement data revealed distinct patterns across the different time intervals. During less restrictive phases, clear movement hotspots emerged near key landmarks such as Big Ben and major subway stations like Waterloo. As restrictions became tighter, overall movement spread more evenly across the entire area. Interestingly, under stricter conditions, hotspots were not solely concentrated around tourist attractions but were also distributed throughout residential neighborhoods, resulting in numerous clusters in these areas.

                        The next area of focus is the Greenwich district, particularly near Greenwich Park. The analysis reveals that during restrictive periods, movement was primarily concentrated in residential neighborhoods, while main streets exhibited significantly fewer clusters. In contrast, during less restrictive times—especially before the COVID-19 pandemic—there was increased activity along major thoroughfares, like the A200 main road.

                        Before the COVID-19 pandemic, distinct clusters were evident within the zoo and sporadically distributed throughout the park. During lockdown periods, movement clusters became more dispersed across other areas of the park, especially during the first lockdown when the zoo was entirely closed. In later lockdowns, the zoo operated under strict regulations, resulting in isolated clusters within the zoo region at specific times. By the end of the year, as restrictions were lifted, the average movement still not returned to normal amounts of movement, which explains the high intensity of clusters in the region. The clusters were once again broadly distributed, including within the zoo.
