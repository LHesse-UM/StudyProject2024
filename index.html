        <h2 id="aboutTheProject">About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project explores human activity patterns in London throughout 2020, a year marked by the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing daily movement data and focusing on Polygons of Interest (POIs), such as transit hubs, parks, and event venues, we aim to understand how the pandemic influenced urban mobility. Our analysis offers insights into the reduction of activity during lockdowns, the rebound effects post-restrictions, and the shifting dynamics of human movement in response to public health measures.</p>

        <h2 id="dataAquiAndProces">Data Acquistion and Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>The foundation of this project is the 2020 movement data of London, which provides daily aggregated metrics of human activity. These data points are complemented by geospatial information, including:

            Geo-coordinates linked to specific locations,
            London borough boundaries, and
            Points of Interest (POIs) categorized by function and significance.
            Preprocessing involved cleaning, mapping, and aggregating the data for analysis. Special focus was given to temporal patterns, allowing us to identify activity trends before, during, and after key COVID-19 milestones, such as lockdown announcements or easing measures.</p>
