        <h2 id="aboutTheProject">1. About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project explores human activity patterns in London throughout 2020, a year marked by the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic. 
            By analyzing daily movement data and focusing on Polygons of Interest (POIs), such as transit hubs, parks, and event venues, we aim to understand how the pandemic influenced urban mobility. 
            Our analysis offers insights into the reduction of activity during lockdowns, the rebound effects post-restrictions, and the shifting dynamics of human movement in response to public health measures.

        <h2 id="dataAquiAndProces">2. Data Acquistion and Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>
            The foundation of this project is the 2020 movement data of London, which provides daily aggregated metrics of human activity. 
            These data points are complemented by geospatial information, including: 
            Geo-coordinates linked to specific locations,
            London borough boundaries, and
            Points of Interest (POIs) categorized by function and significance.
            Preprocessing involved cleaning, mapping, and aggregating the data for analysis. 
            Special focus was given to temporal patterns, allowing us to identify activity trends before, during, and after key COVID-19 milestones, such as lockdown announcements or easing measures.
        </p>

            <h3>2.1 Movement Data</h3>
            <p>
                The movement data of London has a column mean_column. 
                It has a values ranging from 0.000003 to 2.892247.
                These values are to be seen in relation to the average movement in UK.
                1.0 would mean in this case that in this 100x100 area the movement was like the average in the UK.
                0.5 means only half as much and 2.0 means twice as much movement.

            <p>
                The <b>Temporal Data</b> section highlights how mobility patterns in London evolved throughout the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. 
                By dividing the year into <b>distinct intervals</b> aligned with major policy changes and restrictions, 
                we analyze the short- and long-term effects of lockdowns, reopenings, and other interventions on human activity.
            </p>
        
            <h3>2.3.1 Corona Intervals</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                To better understand mobility changes, the year 2020 has been divided into 
                <b>seven key intervals</b>, each corresponding to major COVID-19 measures or milestones.
                The time intervals are based on governmental documents that can be found 
                <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/timeline-lockdown-web.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        <li><b>First Lockdown</b> (Mar 26 - May 10): Strict nationwide lockdown causing sharp declines in movement.</li>
                        <li><b>Return to Relaxing Restrictions</b> (May 11 - Oct 13): Gradual easing of restrictions leading to activity rebounds.</li>
                        <li><b>Three-Tier System</b> (Oct 14 - Nov 4): Regionalized restrictions based on infection rates.</li>

            <h3>2.3.2 Events Dataset</h3>
            <p>
                The <b>Events Dataset</b> focuses on <b>specific dates</b> where notable events and policy decisions occurred. 
                These events include significant football matches, concerts, and public gatherings, 
                particularly in key <b>Polygons of Interest (POIs)</b> such as football stadiums and large event venues. 
                By examining mobility patterns during these events, 
                we gain a deeper understanding of the short-term fluctuations in movement across London.
            </p>
            <p>
                The table below summarizes these significant events, their corresponding dates, and their places:

            <p>
                By analyzing mobility patterns during these <b>events</b>, particularly at football stadiums and event venues, 
                we can identify spikes in activity that correspond to crowd movements. 
                Additionally, when combined with the <b>Corona Intervals</b>, 
                this dataset provides insights into how lockdowns and reopening phases impacted public gatherings at key POIs.
