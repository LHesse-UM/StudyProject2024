## About the Project

This project explores human activity patterns in London throughout 2020, a year marked by the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing daily movement data and focusing on Polygons of Interest (POIs), such as transit hubs, parks, and event venues, we aim to understand how the pandemic influenced urban mobility. Our analysis offers insights into the reduction of activity during lockdowns and the rebound effects post-restrictions.


The project results are publicly available and require no installation or additional setup to explore.
