        The POI analysis was conducted by intersecting pre-defined polygons representing various Polygons of Interest (POIs) with the movement data. 
        This allowed us to isolate mobility patterns specific to each POI. The intersected data was then divided into seven distinct COVID-19 phases for temporal analysis. 
        For each polygon within a phase, the movement data was aggregated, and the mean values were calculated. 
        This approach enabled a detailed examination of mobility trends and changes across different POI categories, 
        providing insights into how urban activity evolved during the pandemic.

                During the Pre-Corona phase, activity levels are highest across all POIs, particularly for bus stations and football stadiums, 
                which show the most significant decline during the First Lockdown. In the Relaxing Restrictions phase, recovery is evident across most POIs, 
                though the levels remain below Pre-Corona values. Notably, parks display smaller reductions in activity during lockdowns compared to other 
                categories, likely due to their role as outdoor leisure spaces. Big event places and football stadiums, however, exhibit a minimal recovery, 
                reflecting ongoing restrictions on large gatherings. Subsequent phases like the Three-Tier System and End of Second Lockdown show relatively 
                stable trends for most POIs, with a gradual recovery in activity for bus stations and subway stations. The Tier 4 phase again reveals a 
                slight decline in activity, particularly for parks and bus stations, indicating the reintroduction of stricter measures. 
                Overall, the chart highlights significant variation in recovery rates across POI categories, with outdoor spaces like parks maintaining 
                steadier activity levels compared to indoor or event-based locations like stadiums and subway stations.</p>

                The match schedule for Arsenal in 2020 provides valuable context for the observed activity trends at the Emirates Stadium. During the Pre-Corona phase, 
                regular matches such as Arsenal vs. Manchester United and Arsenal vs. West Ham contributed to the high activity levels, as fans attended games without 
                restrictions. However, the First Lockdown from March to June 2020 saw a complete suspension of football matches, which aligns with the sharp decline in 
                activity during this period. As restrictions eased in the Relaxing Restrictions phase, matches resumed in July 2020, including Arsenal vs. Norwich and 
                Arsenal vs. Liverpool. Despite the return of games, attendance was limited or prohibited, resulting in only a partial recovery in activity levels. During 
                the subsequent phases, such as the Three-Tier System and Second Lockdown, matches continued, including high-profile games like Arsenal vs. Chelsea and 
                Arsenal vs. Southampton, but fan restrictions led to consistently low activity at the stadium. Later in the year, Europa League matches, such as Arsenal 
                vs. FC Dundalk and Arsenal vs. Rapid Wien, were held at the Emirates Stadium. However, these events also failed to significantly boost activity levels due 
                to ongoing restrictions on spectators.

                During the Pre-Corona phase, activity levels were relatively high, driven by a full schedule of events, including performances by The 1975, The Script, 
                and Strictly Come Dancing. These events attracted large audiences and contributed to consistent activity at the arena. However, with the onset of the First 
                Lockdown in March 2020, all events were canceled or postponed, leading to a sharp decline in activity. Performances by Santana, Maluma, and Cirque du Soleil 
                were among those impacted, resulting in near-zero activity levels during this period. As restrictions eased during the Relaxing Restrictions phase, activity 
                partially resumed, though it remained modest compared to Pre-Corona levels. Smaller-scale events and preparations for future shows contributed to this 
                slight recovery. During the Three-Tier System and Second Lockdown phases, activity remained subdued due to ongoing restrictions and limited attendance. 
                Events like Elton John's concerts were postponed, and the arena operated at minimal capacity. At the end of 2020, activity peaked briefly during the Nitto 
                ATP Finals and Elton John's rescheduled performances. However, this spike was short-lived, and activity quickly declined again as restrictions persisted.

            <h2>Results and Interpretation</h2>
            <p text-align: justify;>
                The POI analysis highlights the spatial and temporal dynamics of human activity at specific Polygons of Interest (POIs) during different phases of the COVID-19 
                pandemic. By examining aggregated activity data for categories such as bus stations, subway stations, parks, football stadiums, and big event venues, several key 
                insights emerge. During the Pre-Corona phase, activity levels were consistently high across most POIs, reflecting regular urban mobility patterns. Locations like 
                bus stations, subway stations, and football stadiums served as key hubs, exhibiting strong clustering of activity.
            </p>
            <p text-align: justify;>
                In the lockdown phases, a significant reduction in activity was observed across nearly all POI categories. Big event venues and football stadiums experienced the 
                sharpest declines due to event cancellations and restrictions on large gatherings. Parks, however, displayed a relatively smaller decrease, highlighting their 
                importance as essential outdoor spaces for recreation. As restrictions eased during the Relaxing Restrictions and Recovery phases, a partial recovery in activity 
                levels was noted, particularly at transportation hubs like bus and subway stations. Big event venues and football stadiums, however, showed limited recovery as 
                attendance remained restricted. Parks maintained steadier activity levels compared to other categories, reflecting a shift in human behavior toward outdoor activities.
            </p>
            <p text-align: justify;>
                The analysis also reveals distinct activity patterns within each POI category. Parks and transportation hubs adapted more quickly to relaxed measures, whereas 
                event-based venues showed prolonged declines. This underscores the varying levels of resilience among POI categories to mobility disruptions. Overall, the POI 
                analysis highlights the significant impact of COVID-19 on urban mobility and activity. Transportation and outdoor spaces showed greater adaptability, while 
                event-based venues faced sustained challenges. These insights provide a valuable basis for planning urban recovery strategies and prioritizing infrastructure 
                resilience in response to future disruptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following key observations stand out:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-Corona Phase: High activity levels were concentrated in transportation hubs, parks, and event venues, reflecting regular urban mobility patterns. Football stadiums and big event venues served as prominent hotspots for clustering. </strong></li>
                <li><strong>Lockdown Phases: Activity dropped significantly across all POIs, with event venues and football stadiums experiencing the steepest declines due to strict restrictions on gatherings. Parks, however, showed a smaller decrease, highlighting their importance as accessible outdoor spaces. </strong></li>
                <li><strong>Relaxing Restrictions: A gradual recovery was observed, particularly in transportation hubs like bus and subway stations. Parks also maintained relatively steady activity levels, while event venues and stadiums recovered more slowly due to ongoing attendance restrictions. </strong></li>
                <li><strong>Recovery Phases: Activity began to normalize, but significant differences remained between POI categories. Outdoor spaces like parks adapted quickly, while event venues continued to struggle, demonstrating their vulnerability to prolonged restrictions. </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These observations underscore the varied impacts of COVID-19 on different POI categories and the importance of resilience planning for future urban disruptions.            </p>
